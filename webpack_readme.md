#Loader
The "style-loader" is responsible for injecting CSS into the page as a <style> tag, while the "css-loader" is responsible for resolving CSS imports and returning CSS code as a string. In other words, the "css-loader" processes CSS files and transforms them into a format that can be consumed by the "style-loader", which then injects the CSS into the page.

#React Loadable package
When you use "react-loadable" with Webpack, it enables you to split your React code into smaller chunks that can be loaded on demand. This can improve the performance of your application by reducing the initial bundle size and only loading the code that is needed when it is needed.

"react-loadable" provides a higher-order component that allows you to load components with dynamic imports. When you use this component to load a component, Webpack automatically creates a separate chunk for that component and its dependencies, which can be loaded on demand when the component is needed.

To help Webpack generate the necessary code splitting and chunk loading logic, "react-loadable" also provides the "ReactLoadablePlugin". This plugin creates a JSON file that contains information about the code splitting and chunk loading that is needed for each component that is loaded with "react-loadable".

Overall, "react-loadable" simplifies the process of code splitting and lazy loading in React applications, making it easier to improve performance and reduce initial load times.
