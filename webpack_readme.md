#loader

The "style-loader" is responsible for injecting CSS into the page as a <style> tag, while the "css-loader" is responsible for resolving CSS imports and returning CSS code as a string. In other words, the "css-loader" processes CSS files and transforms them into a format that can be consumed by the "style-loader", which then injects the CSS into the page.
